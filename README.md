## How to Use This Course

### For Instructors

Each lesson is designed to be completed in a 2-3 hour session including:
- 45-60 minutes of instruction/demonstration
- 60-90 minutes of hands-on practice
- Homework exercises for additional practice

Lessons build on each other sequentially. We recommend following the order presented, though Blocks 4 and 5 can be partially customized based on student interests.

### For Students

2. **Read through the content** and run code chunks as you go
3. **Complete the practice exercises** embedded in each lesson
4. **Attempt the homework** to reinforce learning
5. **Experiment** with the code - modify parameters and see what happens!

## Required R Packages

All lessons use tidyverse-compatible packages. The most frequently used packages are:

**Core tidyverse:**
- `dplyr` - data transformation
- `ggplot2` - data visualization
- `tidyr` - data reshaping
- `readr` - data import
- `purrr` - functional programming
- `stringr` - string manipulation
- `lubridate` - date/time handling

**Statistics and modeling:**
- `rstatix` - tidy statistical tests
- `broom` - tidy model outputs
- `tidymodels` - machine learning framework

**Reproducibility:**
- `here` - file path management
- `renv` - dependency management
- `rmarkdown` - reproducible reports

**Domain-specific:**
- Dataset-specific packages are introduced in relevant lessons

## Datasets

All datasets are small enough to work efficiently on posit.cloud's free tier. Datasets include:

- `palmerpenguins::penguins` - penguin morphology (Lessons 1-6)
- Simulated biological datasets for specific concepts
- Real-world subsampled datasets for case studies (RNA-seq, microbiome, metagenomics)

## Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

1. **Tidyverse first**: Modern R syntax using tidyverse packages over base R when possible
2. **Reproducibility**: All analyses should be reproducible from RMarkdown documents
3. **Real biology**: Examples and datasets from actual biological research
4. **Practical skills**: Focus on workflows students will use in their research
5. **Progressive complexity**: Building skills gradually from foundations to advanced applications
